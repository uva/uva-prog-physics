## Summary

At the end of this week, you should be able to perform the following tasks. If you do not understand what is meant by the following tasks or cannot perform them, have another look at the exercises, or ask an assistant to help you out.

* Use a function to create ball tuples with a random velocity.
* Save a list of tuples and update the list (using a double loop to update each element for every step).
* Collect information about the list while updating, for later plotting.
* Determine the average distance in a list of ball tuples.
* Remove tuples from the list under certain conditions.
