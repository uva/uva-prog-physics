* Calculate the step size `dx` for a range of 0-10 in 50 steps.
* Calculate the number of steps for a range of 0-10 and a step size of 0.02.
* Define a function that adds the values of $f(x)=x^2$ in the range 0-1. Use a `for` loop.
* Generate a random number between 5 and 8 using the function `random()`.
* Use a `for` loop to find the maximum of the function $f(x)=x^2$ in the range 0-1.
