## Summary

At the end of this week, you should be able to perform the following tasks. If you do not understand what is meant by the following tasks or cannot perform them, have another look at the exercises, or ask an assistant to help you out.

* Use a `for` loop to compute the sum of a number of function values.
* Use a step size $<1$ for the iteration variable in a `for` loop (e.g. $\Delta x=0.01$).
* Generate a random number in an arbitrary range.
* Determine the range of a function in a given domain (determine $y_min$ and $y_max$).
* For a number of random points, determine which fraction falls within a function boundary.
* Use several connected lists of data in a function of several variables.
* Use a double `for` loop to optimize a variable in a function that contains a sum.
* Find the element of a list that is closest to a given value.
