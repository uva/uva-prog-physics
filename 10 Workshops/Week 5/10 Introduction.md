This workshop will kick off your 9th day of Python programming. Today, you'll
learn about everything about data types in Python, and something about
debugging!

## Preparation

Read and annotate these chapters from your book:

* Chapter 9, Dictionaries
* Chapter 10, Tuples
* Chapter 11, Files
* Chapter A, Debugging

Don't read too slowly, you do not need to understand it all and you definitely
do not need to memorize. Still, your programming work will finish a lot faster
when you prepare like this.

## What to turn in after you finish programming

You are to hand in the answers to the exercises, three python source code files
that we can test, and optionally one or two python files for the hacker edition.

## Deadline

The deadline is Friday at 15:00. However, you are required to review your
exercises with an assistant at the second day of class.
