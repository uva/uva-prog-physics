This workshop will kick off your 5th day of Python programming. Today, you'll
learn about everything about functions!

### Preparation

Read and annotate these chapters from your book:

* Chapter 3, Functions
* Chapter 4.8--4.12, Recursion
* Chapter 5, Fruitful functions
* Chapter 7, Strings

Don't read too slowly, you do not need to understand it all and you definitely
do not need to memorize. Still, your programming work will finish a lot faster
when you prepare like this.

### What to turn in after you finish programming

You are to hand in the answers to the exercises, three python source code files
that we can test, and optionally one or two python files for the hacker edition.

### Deadline

The deadline is on your last day of class at 18:00 (either Thursday or Friday). You are required to review your exercises with an assistant at the second day of class.
