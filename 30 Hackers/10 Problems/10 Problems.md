## Hacker problems

Please try these problems, but only at your own risk! You must make sure that you submit *something* working at the end of the week!

Don't forget that you will not score more points *per se* by doing hacker problems, and that you should always prioritize improving your code style and design above adding extra features or doing hacker problems.
