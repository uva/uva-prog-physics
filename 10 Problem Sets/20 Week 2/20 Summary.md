* Convert a problem into a sequence of small steps that can be written in code.
* Confine the range of your problem to a workable size for which you can check the answers.
* Choose between a `for` and a `while` loop, depending on when the loop should end.
* Check if a number is prime.
* Fill a list with prime numbers.
* Keep track of events in a `for` loop using one or more variables (e.g. finding a divisor or finding a range of non-primes).
* Check if a list contains an element by manually looping through the list.
* Find the sum of divisors of a number.
